# toBeDetermined

## Project Overview:

Determine the effect that paying back a college loan would have on a college graduate’s budget after school. One could use this information to understand how much of a loan a person should take out to go to school. 

Utilizing user input of high school standardized testing scores, the program will recommend majors to them based on their academic strengths. Since there is a correlation between students from lower income households and lower testing scores, this program would be especially helpful to students from lower income households in letting them know what student loans they can afford and to give them an idea of their future salary. 

## Formula to determine monthly payments:

 Payment =    ( r_) * ____Loan Amount______
                      	 12          1   -     __1___
			                	    (1 + r/12)n                                               
                           
  r = interest rate (expressed as a decimal.  (Ex. 3.5% = .035)
	n = loan length expressed in months. (Ex. a ten-year loan = 120 months)

 Calculate the monthly loan amount for various lengths of loans:
       5 years; 10 years; 15 years; 20 years; 30 years

 Find interest rates and amounts for various private and government loans for college.

Use the loan and the salary information to determine what percentage of any  particular college graduate’s salary would go towards their loan repayments. 

Divide the salary by 12 to get monthly amount, then the percentage of the loan relative to one’s salary = (monthly loan payment)/(monthly salary) * 100.

## Pseudocode for program:
Prompt for average Tilt Score ->

Display suggested majors based on avg tilt score ->

Prompt for major → 

prompt for job title →
 
prompt for loan amount → 

prompt for interest rate → 

prompt for term of loan → 

output: major, job, salary, term of loan, amount of loan, interest rate, monthly loan payment →

## Example output:

This is an interactive program that prompts the user to choose a major from a four-year university, then choose a corresponding job title. The user will input information about their student loan to determine if their average salary will be able to cover their monthly loan payments. This is applicable to universities in the United States only.

Would you like to use your Tilt Score to determine your major? (yes/no)

These are the majors that correspond to your Tilt Score:

Jobs you can get with a four-year + major + degree:
//prints jobs associated with major

Which job interests you?

Based on your careers of interest the following prompts will provide some information on your student loan payments.

Student loan amount: $

Student loan rate (as a percent):

Term of loan (in years):

Summary of provided information example:

Chosen major: Biology
Chosen job: Teacher
Average yearly salary: $45,000
Loan amount: $100,000
Interest rate: 4.5%
Term of loan: 20 years
Monthly loan payment: $632
Percentage of monthly salary going toward loan: 17%

This is the end of the program.

## Graphics:
The lower the percentage of your monthly salary going toward loan, the lower (greener) the meter and vise versa. Green would mean <=10%, yellow 10% to <=15%, orange 15% to <=20%, and red >20%.
